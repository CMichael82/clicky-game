# clicky-game

## Trilogy Boot-Camp Assignment 19

### Objective: 
Create a memory game that renders different images on the screen and that keeps track of the user's score. The score is incremented when clicking an image for the first time and resets to 0 if the user clicks the same image twice. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page will shuffle themselves in a random order. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game should restart.
